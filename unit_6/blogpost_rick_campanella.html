		<h1>Meet Rick Campanella</h1>
		<p>“I started thinking about photography fairly early in life. While growing up it seemed that every time my family posed for a photo, I was asked to do the honors. When I was 10 I got a little camera but soon realized that I couldn’t pay for film developing so I never got to use it. I was almost 30 by the time I bought a 35mm Nikon and learned film and slide photography, and got a bit of recognition by my camera club.  Within a decade, the Digital Revolution had begun and it turned me off photography. I hated the clunky digital cameras and that their lenses weren’t interchangeable.  And of course digital image manipulation software seemed to cheapen the “purity” of film photography.<p>

		<p>By 2009 I’d noticed the emergence of DSLR cameras. I bought a Nikon D90 and for two years shot it in auto mode and never post-processed a single JPEG file… But after losing the D90 in a taxi one drunken night, I read everything I could to learn which camera I should buy to replace it.  The research made me aware of all the things I had been too lazy to try with my D90.  So I bought a D7000 and started shooting RAW in manual mode until that camera was stolen 6 months later. I bought a D7100 and built up a good collection of lenses, tripods, lights and most importantly, post-processing software.  Learning Adobe’s Lightroom and Photoshop opened a world of creative possibilities for me to express my personal interpretation of the images I saw in my mind. I developed my style based on HDR with great detail and vibrancy, however I wanted to avoid the overly-processed look everyone hates about HDR, so I worked on ways to make my images smoother and more realistic.<p>

		<p>During the past few years my photography has progressed rapidly. I was fortunate enough to travel frequently to Europe and China, and of course my apartment on Times Square makes finding inspiration really easy. November 2014, I began contributing to W42ST Magazine in their debut issue and have been published regularly ever since. Lately I have been getting commissioned by performers who play NYC Jazz clubs to capture them in action and also for head shots and portraits. Most of my photos are available for purchase as prints, on a variety of surfaces (aluminum, paper, canvas, etc.) with many framing options. The images can also be licensed for use in websites and advertising media.”<p>
